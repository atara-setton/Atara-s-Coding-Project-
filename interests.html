            <p>Good Food/Nutritive Food
               Good food does not mean the costly food. The food which is helpful for our body, mind and health and which helps to prevent all the diseases from our body is considered as good food. Generally, a balanced diet contains all elements of food-carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral salt and water. We cannot avoid eating food because it gives us energy and the nutritional requirements we need to survive. Despite the many types of food available for us to enjoy, we should still remember to eat mostly fruits and vegetables because these are the only foods that have high nutritious importance. They are essential in promoting good health and keeping us fit from the insides, because eating too much unhealthy products such as fast foods have no nutritional value at all. Meat is also important because these are rich in protein and iron, as well as other nutrients that fruits and vegetables alone cannot give. It’s also important to choose the proper types of meat to stay healthy, such as bony meats and seafood. Grains also make up an important part of a healthy diet because they are loaded with fiber, antioxidants, b-vitamins, and minerals. The eating of more grains has significant health benefits such as lower risk of: Heart disease, fatness, indigestion, and certain kinds of cancers. It’s highly recommended to consume grains and other forms of fiber on a daily basis; good sources include brown bread, barley, and turmeric.</p>
