        <h3>Poems about Friendship

        Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always there to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes and they look out for your best interest. This kind of friend can be hard to find, but they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime. Other friends may not be quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal is not easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought about by a loving friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.</h3>

        <p>I think awhile of Love, and while I think, 
            Love is to me a world, 
            Sole meat and sweetest drink, 
            And close connecting link 
            Tween heaven and earth. 
            
            I only know it is, not how or why, 
            My greatest happiness; 
            However hard I try, 
            Not if I were to die, 
            Can I explain. 
            
            I fain would ask my friend how it can be, 
            But when the time arrives, 
            Then Love is more lovely 
            Than anything to me, 
            And so I'm dumb. 
            
            For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, 
            But only thinks and does; 
            Though surely out 'twill leak 
            Without the help of Greek, 
            Or any tongue. 
            
            A man may love the truth and practise it, 
            Beauty he may admire, 
            And goodness not omit, 
            As much as may befit 
            To reverence. 
            
            But only when these three together meet, 
            As they always incline, 
            And make one soul the seat, 
            And favorite retreat, 
            Of loveliness; 
            
            When under kindred shape, like loves and hates 
            And a kindred nature, 
            Proclaim us to be mates, 
            Exposed to equal fates 
            Eternally; 
            
            And each may other help, and service do, 
            Drawing Love's bands more tight, 
            Service he ne'er shall rue 
            While one and one make two, 
            And two are one; 
            
            In such case only doth man fully prove 
            Fully as man can do, 
            What power there is in Love 
            His inmost soul to move 
            Resistlessly. 
            
            ______ 
            
            Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side, 
            Withstand the winter's storm, 
            And spite of wind and tide, 
            Grow up the meadow's pride, 
            For both are strong 
            
            Above they barely touch, but undermined 
            Down to their deepest source, 
            Admiring you shall find 
            Their roots are intertwined 
            Insep'rably. </p>
